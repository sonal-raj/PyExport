### Professional Report generation and export framework

A versatile library to play around with reports and data formats. Generate beautiful and professional reports from manual and automated processes and export them - send them as an email, dump as a web page, store pdf reports for client usage and many more. Docster is fully customizable and comes with several themes out of the box. Support for jinja templates will be added soon.
